# Covid-case-tracker

This application gives the counts of various covid related data such as total test done, total victims, total cured, deaths, etc in a GUI interface. Also, it can download statewise data and store it in csv file.

***Note- The structure of source code of website keeps varying as the website is dynamic. A code working fine at given point of time may not work as expected after a while since the structure of website changes. For the reference I have attached corresponding csv file and a demo video which would help to understand better.***

**Thank you.**
